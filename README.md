Simulation for the construction presented here:
https://www.elektroda.pl/rtvforum/topic3278605.html
Run in scilab 5.x.x

```
Total weight of the pilot with the vehicle = 100kg
Constant acceleration = 0,6m/s
Constant braking = 2m/s
Maximum speed = 10m/s<->36km/h
Distance = ~20km
Battery = 10S10P Liion 18650 27Ah (~5kg of weight)
And other random parameters (but possible)
```
